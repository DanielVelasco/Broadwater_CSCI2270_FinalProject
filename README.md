# Broadwater_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
The program uses a priority queue to store deliviers based on their priority. Users can enter a list of deliveries to be made and the ones that have the most priority, and the queue can output them in either highest or lowest priority first. The priority queue can also be used to store arrays of multiple deliviers in the same priority spot using arrays, should it prove necessary.

How to Run:
Copy the three files named 'project1.cpp', 'pqueue.cpp', and 'pqueue.h' to your VM, and make a new project in codeblocks, and delete the file in the new project named 'main.cpp'. Rename 'project1.cpp' to main.cpp, and add all the files to the codeblocks project, then compile and run it at your leisure. This process could also be done manually using g++ but I don't know how to do that off the top of my head.
